What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  - Padding and margin controls are still giving me a bit of trouble, but I'm steadily getting more comfortable with them. Challenge 3.4 helped a lot in understanding what the different commands do.
What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  - I learned to make good use of the "clear: both" command in CSS. After spending almost 45 minutes trying to get an object to stop colliding with another, I remembered that I had the other item floated, and simply used clear: both to move the new object below it. Problem solved with 1 line of CSS.
What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  - I felt that the easiest changes were the small cosmetic effects such as font, color, and sizes. The hardest thing to implement were the positions of objects.
What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  - It's important to keep your html elements in a clear and concise order, and not to make things too vague or specific. It's easy to get in too deep if you don't step back and look from a different angle.
