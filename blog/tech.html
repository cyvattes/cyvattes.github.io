        <h3>Computer Memory</h3>
        <h4>Feb 19, 2016</h4>
        <p>
          Today I'm going to discuss something that may not be terribly useful, but I think it's fascinating. It also bugs me... a lot, so hopefully this will keep up-and-coming computer users to date, and stop the spread of wrong information in computer memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm talking, of course, of the difference between a megabyte (MB) and a mebibyte (MiB).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's back up for a second, though. First let's quickly go over what exactly a byte is. Well, traditionally, a byte is 8 bits, and bit is simply a binary unit for 0 or 1. The byte was originally developed as a means of storing text data, and each byte stores 2x10^8 values (from 0 to 255). As storage became smaller and cheaper, we moved up to kilobytes, megabytes, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this is where things get a bit confusing. A kilobyte was originally 1024 bytes (because we're using powers of 2 when we describe the number of binary units). This changed in 1998, however, and a kilobyte is now OFFICIALLY labeled as 1000 bytes (in keeping with the SI standard of measures).
        </p>
        <p>
          So if they changed how much a kilobyte is, then why do we always hear that 1024 is the magic number? Well, since storage has gotten large enough that individual bytes are relatively unimportant, we typically still just use kilobytes to mean either (even though it's not the same). Now, however, the official term for 1024 bytes is a "kibibyte", with "kibi" meaning 2^10 (or 1024). 
        </p>
        <p>
          This trend continues for all magnitudes of data: megabyte (1000 kilobytes) vs mebibyte (1024 kibibytes); gigabyte (1000 megabytes) vs gibibyte (1024 mebibytes); and so on. The only reason that we still use megabyte as a standard is because it's used loosely by engineers (as an old convention), and passed along as false information.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's it, the mystery of the seldom-used kibibyte and its cousins. So let's do the IEC proud (and save me a headache) by using kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and more to represent the PROPER amount of data, 1000 times the value of their predecessor, and do away with teaching everyone outdated information.
