        <h3>Regarding the Recent Update</h3>
        <h4>Feb 25, 2016</h4>
        <p>
          I'm super happy to have updated my site (and blog pages) this week, and wanted to touch on some of the changes briefly. A few of the old links didn't work, but everything has been fixed. Obviously, there has been a visual update as well, and there will be some small changes in the weeks to come (mostly regarding icons and such).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent a lot of time making sure that everything resized well on different monitors, and this is something which was brought up in our discussion group. It feels great when someone notices your optimizations. Each page has also been revised for efficiency and consistency. Several pages and documents have been removed, such as the blog stylesheet, which became redundant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last think I want to note is that someone commented on my use of the same icons for my blog links (the purple quote icons), saying that maybe they would be better if they were all different. I kind of like them as they are, but we'll see how others feel about it and make changes accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I'm really glad to finally have everything updated from that ugly yellow and red mess that I build before, and I'll do my best to keep things minimalistic and pleasing to the eye moving forward.
