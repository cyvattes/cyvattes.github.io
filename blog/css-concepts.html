        <h3>Display: Inline vs Inline-Block</h3>
        <h4>Jan 13, 2016</h4>
        <p>
          There are several ways in which CSS can change the way objects are displayed. Today I'll discuss two of them: the "display: inline" and "display: inline-block" commands. While similar, they can cause your page to do some strange things if you aren't careful.
        </p>
        <p>
          First on our list is display:inline. What's important to remember is that displaying an object (or div) inline will cause it to lose its any previous status as a block. This can make objects stack on top of each other. This could be good (if you want headers to cover part of a background image, for example), but can interfere with some interactions if you aren't careful. What the command does is allow objects to appear on the same line as each other, letting you stack several objects horizontally on your page. As I said, though, it gets rid of the block surrounding the item, so they will start to collide if you aren't careful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Display:inline-block, on the other hand, is a sort of hybrid between a block and the display:inline command. It will allow items to stack horizontally (like inline), but will retain the block designation of the object, keeping them from interacting or colliding with each other. This way, you can put images, blocks of text, or buttons next to each other without worrying about losing track of them.
