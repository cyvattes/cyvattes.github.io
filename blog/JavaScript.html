        <h1>Looping: Ruby vs JavaScript</h1>

          Looping is one of my favorite (and easiest) ways of iterating over data in many proramming languages. Most languages handle loops in mostly the same way, and the syntax can be almost identical. However, Ruby and JavaScript have pretty different ways of starting and writing loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite way of looping in Ruby is the .each method, which simply iterates over 'each' data point in a set. It's simple, easy to use, and elegant (3 things I like my life to be).
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, however, there's no .each method, so we have to use something else. The 'for' and 'while' loops are probably the easiest to use, and work in almost the same way as those loops in Ruby. The big difference is in the syntax: mainly that you need to wrap everything in curly braces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops in JavaScript do have one really cool feature, though. Built in counters. Unlike Ruby where you have to create your own counters for keeping track of how many times you've looped, they're more-or-less required in JavaScript. To create a 'for' loop, you define it as "for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)", which simply means that your counter is set to whatever you want, the code block loops until the center condition is met, and at the end of each loop it does whatever is in the last phrase (in this case, it increases by one).
