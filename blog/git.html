        What exactly is version control? And what is this "git" thing everyone keeps talking about? Well, version control lets you keep different copies of your projects (versions) so that you can make changes to your heart's content without worrying about permanently screwing something up. Imagine if you were writing a paper, and every time you saved your work was as a different version (ie. paper_v1, paper_v1.2, etc). That way, if you decided that you didn't like a certain papagraph and wanted to retype it, you could do so. Then if you change your mind later, all your previous work is saved for you, instead of lost to oblivion.

        Git is simply a great tool for version control. You install it on your system, and through a series of relatively simple commands you can create different versions of your code. This is done by separating your work into a tree-ike structure, breaking your versions into a trunk (the master copy) and its branches (literally called branches). By creating a new branch, you can make changes to your code, add or modify directories and files, or delete unwanted items without affecting the core of your project. Once changes are made and double and triple checked, you can merge them back into your master (or another branch).

        Another tool at your disposal is a hub for a multitude of repositories handled with git. GitHub, as it's called, keeps your committed repositories on the cloud and allows for sharing between different individuals and groups. People can help you spot errors, you can use bits of open source code as a foundation for your own projects, or you can collaborate with others to produce software. It's easy to use, open to anyone, and widely used by developers.
