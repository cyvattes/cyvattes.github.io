    - How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
        Creating HTML with a pair was pretty simple, but our wireframing ideas started out being pretty different. We ended up deciding on a pretty simple layout that could be expanded upon later.
    - Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
        Wireframing made coding the page in html pretty straightforward, getting rid of any need to design and code at the same time.
    - What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
        We decided to stay simple, leaving links and pictures in their own section and having the body of the blog posts in their own discrete block in the center of the page.
    - What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
        I didn't learn about any new elements in this challenge, although it gave me some practice with tables.
