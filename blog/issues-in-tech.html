        <h3>Issues in Tech: Agriculture</h3>
        <h4>Jan 24, 2016</h4>
        <p>
          Today I'd like to write about something that perhaps isn't unique to the tech industry, but something which is forcing the tech industry to adapt and take part in nonetheless. Agriculture and agrotechnology is something which is very near to my heart, and I want to discuss some of the things that make it an important issue for businesses seeking technological innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let me rattle off some statistics taken directly from the UN's World Food Programme.
          Roughly 13% of the world population is undernourished. This means that their food intake is too low to allow for healthy living. This percentage equates to almost 800 million people worldwide (â…” of whom are in Asia).
          Of this 13%, almost 25% live in sub-Saharan Africa. This region has the highest prevalence (percent of overall population) of undernourishment.
          Poor nutrition accounts for almost half of infant deaths (less than 5 years old) worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there are many reasons for the prevalence and locations of worldwide food shortages, but I want to reduce this down to just two: population density and availability of fertile land. These issues look pretty different on the surface, but they're really quite similar. In the areas with too little food for the population, there are either too many people per square acre of viable farmland, or there is too little farmland to feed the local populace.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings me to my point: agricultural technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have recently been big strides made in the realms of hydroponics, renewable farming, and heightened food productivity, and the more we understand the science of agriculture the more we understand that technology can (and will) change the landscape of food production.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to bring your attention to Mirai, INC., a Japanese aquaculture company founded in 2005. In 2014, Mirai opened a brand-new hydroponic farm in an abandoned sony building, and has been flooding the news with its breakthroughs since. Because of their use of physiologist, engineers, and some clever computer programming, they have been able to create a process to grow food almost completely autonomously. Even more impressive, is this production facility uses around 99% less water than commercial farms, and produces food 250% faster, 100 times denser (100x food production per square foot), and uses 40% less electricity than its competitors (other Japanese hydro farms).
        </p>
        <p>
          And Mirai is far from the only company making headway to solve the world food shortage. The Granpa Dome (also in Japan) uses computer technology and clever engineering to create a self-sustaining rotating plant bed that changes the spectrum of light, nutrients in the water, and position of the plants automatically to encourage plants to grow quicker and larger than they wood in a traditional farm.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hope is that in the next ten years we will be able to solve the problems of location and population density as they cause food supply problems, as we are on the verge of smart farms that can be placed in any climate, or that take up very little room in a city, that can produce the local foods of a region. With some smart design and programming, farming is changing every year, and I can't wait to see what happens next.
